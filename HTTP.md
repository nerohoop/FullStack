## Response Headers

**Content-Length**
Must be contained in every response and tells the browser the size of the body in the reponse. This way the browser knows how many bytes it can expect to receive after the header section and can show you a meaningful progress bar when downloading a file

**Content-Type**
Non-optional and tells you what type the document has. This way the browser knows which parsing engine to spin up.

**Last-Modified**
When the document was last changed. It turned out that the Last-Modified date is not very reliable when trying to figure out if a document has been changed.

To accommodate this, most servers also send an ETag. ETag stand for entity tag, and is a unique identifier that changes solely depending on the content of the file. Most servers actually use a hash function to calculate the ETag.

**Cache-Control**
It allows the server to control how and for how long the client will cache the response.

**If-Modified-Since**
Permits the server to skip sending the actual content of the document if it hasnâ€™t been changed since the date provided in that header.

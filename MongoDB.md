## NoSQL database
MongoDB is a NoSQL database which stores data in collections and documents, as opposed to tables and rows in SQL.

## Non-Relational
MongoDB doesn't have certain queries that we would have in a SQL database like the JOIN command.

MongoDB is a document database which belongs to a family of databases called NoSQL - not only SQL. In MongoDB, records are documents which behave a lot like JSON objects in JavaScript. Values in documents can be looked up by their fieldâ€™s key. Documents can have some fields/keys and not others, which makes Mongo extremely flexible.

This is different than SQL databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL, where fields correspond to columns in a table and individual records correspond to rows.
